# UW Coding Bootcamp Module 13 Challenge: E-commerce Back End

This express app uses sequelize to interact with a MySQL database and allows a user to recieve data, update data, create data, and delete data when leveraging the appropriatae api route. To start the app, a user must use sql to use the desired database, and seed the database with predefined data. Next, a user is required to run npm start to initalize the local server so the api routes can be accessed. Using insomnia will allow a user to get, update, create, and delete data in the table using the GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE routing methods and the corresponding api routes.
